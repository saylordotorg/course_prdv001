**Unit 3: Computer Security and Troubleshooting** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this final unit of the course, we will build upon the previous
concepts discussed and examine computer security and learn common
troubleshooting techniques.  The following four subunits will allow us
to identify common security threats and provide recommendations for
enhancing your security.  Periodic computer issues are to be expected,
as computers do not always perform or function properly, and we will
identify common problems and learn how to resolve some of these issues.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**
